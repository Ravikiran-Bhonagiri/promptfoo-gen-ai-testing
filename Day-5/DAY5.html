Bathed in night&#39;s silent coat, it shines,
The moon, a lantern in the cosmic mines.
Undeterred by the blanket of darkest skies,
Bewitching allure in its serene guise.

Unseen hands paint it gold and silver streak,
Guiding lost souls, solace thus they seek.
Arched in the depth of heavenly array,
Reflected in seas till the break of day.

Spelling tales of love, raising tides of emotion,
Unfettered beacon amidst the void&#39;s commotion.
Secrets hidden in its cratered face, a silent song,
Suspended as the night&#39;s fervent gong.

Oh, silvery-sheen moon, with your soft glow,
Drizzle your peace on this troubled globe below.
Bathing creation in your gentle light,
Stand strong, serene guide through the night.

The sky appears blue because of a process called Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through, but much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules and then reemitted in different directions. The blue light is scattered in all directions more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is known as Rayleigh scattering. When we look at the sky, we see this blue light scattered from all parts of the sky, not just from the direction of the sun, making the sky appear blue.
