Would you like me to do one or the other, or is there something else I can help you with?

The square root of -1 is **i**, which is called the imaginary unit.

In mathematics, **i** is defined as the number that satisfies the equation i² = -1. This means that i × i = -1.

Since no real number squared can give a negative result (positive × positive = positive, and negative × negative = positive), mathematicians created this new type of number to extend our number system. This led to the development of complex numbers, which have the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.

The imaginary unit i is fundamental in many areas of mathematics, physics, and engineering, particularly in fields like electrical engineering, quantum mechanics, and signal processing.
